  - "The pattern on it, I\u2019ve seen it before... Does this mean I need to enter
    a three-digit number?"
  - "Let\u2019s review the information I\u2019ve seen so far."

  - '''Darkness brought us destruction, but the moths in the forest relied on the
    life force of nature to resist its invasion.'' ''Over decades, ONE miracle is
    always born from the moths.'' ''They are the seeds of light in their species,
    human-shaped moths.'''
  - '''Question: How many miracles can be born over decades?'''
  - "\u2018Unlike them, we could only rely on fire and darkness to fight, until the
    fire gradually went out.\u2019\u2018One day, THREE human-shaped moths saw our
    fire and flew from the forest to us.\u2019\u2018We were filled with hatred for
    them, took their lives, and threw them into the fire.\u2019"
  - "\u2018Question: How many miracles were sacrificed by us?\u2019"
  - '''The burning of the moths created light, a light so powerful it reached the
    sky and lasted for FIVE decades.''''These lights attracted even more, and we
    finally realized that they could make our light never fade.'''
  - '''Question: How many decades did the miracle burn for?'''
  - It looks like some kind of program.
  - Should I start it?
